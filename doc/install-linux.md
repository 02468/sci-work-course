Linux TeX Installation instructions
===================================

To use LaTeX, you need two pieces of software:

* A LaTeX distribution
* A LaTeX editor

The distribution contains all the tools, libraries, documentation and styles
that you will need for creating documents. A good editor makes writing and invoking
the necessary commands to build a PDF from the LaTeX/BibTeX sources trivial.

We recommend:

* [TeXLive Distribution](https://www.tug.org/texlive/). It is rather large (~2.9 GiB) but complete and up-to-date.
* [Texmaker](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/). Free software, cross-platform, easy to configure yet powerful.

Installation via Command line
-----------------------------

### Ubuntu / Debian

In a terminal:

```
sudo apt-get install texlive-core
sudo apt-get install texmaker
```
TexLive

Klick on the link for the archive file for linux "install-tl-unx.tar.gz(3.3mb)" to download the package.

If the download isn't starting, reload this page until you hit a working mirror.

Once download has finished, open your downloads folder and unpack install-tl-unx.tar.gz to any direction.
